# MonoGameDesktopTemplate-YRDSB
A MonoGame Desktop template specifically adapted for use on limited-permission systems that do not allow the standard MonoGame installation.

This template works by leveraging the NuGet package manager to bundle MonoGame with a project template that automates the content output. The template also bundles the MonoGame content build (MGCB) pipeline tool.
